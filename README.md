### Summary

Simple animation that sweeps through different values for parameters of a [superformula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superformula). Found this article after reading about the programming behind [No Man's Sky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Man%27s_Sky)! 

Will randomly sweep through values of a, b, m, n<sub>1</sub>, n<sub>2</sub>, n<sub>3</sub> to generate neat shapes. ![superformula](https://upload.wikimedia.org/math/0/5/2/05217e6762234c9396f6a55b522c9274.png)



### Requirements

Requires SDL2 for graphics. I included all the necessary files along with the .exe to avoid the hassle of installing SDL.
